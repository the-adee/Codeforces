# 🏁 Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to **Codeforces** problems, organized by contest, problem index, and difficulty (where applicable).

## 🚀 Languages Used

- 🟦 C++
- ☕ Java (for some problems)

## 📁 Folder Structure

```shell
/Contests/
└── /CF_XXXX_ContestName/
├── A_ProblemName.cpp
├── B_ProblemName.cpp
└── ...
/Practice/
└── /ProblemName_ID.cpp/
```



- `CF_XXXX_ContestName` = Contest number & name (e.g., `CF_1851_Div2`)
- Files named by **problem index + name** for clarity

## ✅ Progress Snapshot

| Activity        | Count         |
|-----------------|-------        |
| Contests Entered | 1            |
| Contest Problems Solved | 3     |
| Practice Problems Solved | 3    |
| Total Problems Solved | 6       |


## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Implementation
- Greedy
- Two Pointers
- Prefix Sums
- Brute Force
- Math

...and many more as I progress through contests.

## 📌 Notes

- Most solutions are written during live contests or for practice.
- Naming conventions aim to be intuitive for quick navigation.
- Comments included where logic may be tricky or non-obvious.
- Some code may not be fully optimized — written under time pressure!

## 📈 Upcoming Plans

- Solve problems by topic tags (e.g., `/by_topic/greedy/`)
- Track rating progression
- Add Python support for algorithmic prototyping
